# Hi I am Akhil Balineni ðŸ‘‹

I am a machine learning and data enthusiast. I build models that find patterns in data and prototypes that solve real world problems. I focus on image models, data processing at scale, and applied NLP.

## What I build
â€¢ Image based disease detection systems  
â€¢ Scalable cloud pipelines for model inference  
â€¢ Data analysis and insight engines for large datasets  
â€¢ UI prototypes that mirror real product design

## Featured projects
â€¢ **PlantPathoVision**  
  CNN based plant disease detector trained on PlantVillage. 85 percent test accuracy.

â€¢ **ElasticImageRecognitionAPI**  
  Scalable AWS pipeline that processes images from a queue and stores labeled results in S3.

â€¢ **YelpDataMiningProject**  
  Large scale analysis of Yelp data with SQL logic and sentiment analysis.

â€¢ **AppleWebsiteClone**  
  High fidelity front end prototype replicating Apple home page interactions.

## How I work
I move from data to working demo fast. I prefer clear experiments, repeatable pipelines, and reproducible results. I share notebooks and short demo readmes so others can reproduce my steps.
